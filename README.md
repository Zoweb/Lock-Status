# Lock Status
####  Lock Status is a small program to display the status of the lock keys, as some keyboards do not have this capability.

To use Lock Status, download the latest release .exe file from the `releases` branch, and run it.

Lock Status is a completely portable executable file, that does not contain viruses. To check for problems in your local version, use an MD5 checksum tool like Microsoft's [File Checksum Integrity Verifier](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533 "Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier") with the [release version].md5.hash and [release version].sha1.hash files.

Lock Status has a simple window: <img alt="Lock Status preview" title="Lock Status preview" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZvhNJ7D.png" width="100">
This window displays the current status of the Caps, Num and Scroll lock keys. The window will always keep in front of any other windows, but currently does stay on all desktops in Windows 10.

Lock Status's check boxes change even when the window is not focused.
